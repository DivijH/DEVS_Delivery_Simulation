# DEVS_Delivery_Simulation

This is the final project for my course CSE 561 : Modelling and Simulation Theory at Arizona State University. This project runs on DEVS simulator, which can be downloaded from the link https://sourceforge.net/projects/devs-suitesim/

The project runs a simulation of delivering items from a warehouse throughout a city and gives the output of Total cost to the company and Average Delivery Time for each delivery.

You can see a running demo on this link :- https://youtu.be/w6JJoXSHAsQ
